====== Bibliography ======

All the bibliography in the wiki is relevant to the curricular units or the thesis and each publication is expected to be read and analyzed in some depth. All other references will be managed using Mendeley (or a similar strategy), with individual BibTeX files maintained through JabRef for particular applications (e.g., a curricular unit, an assignment, the thesis proposal).
